Terminal_Duel is a simple Python program that runs a terminal-based game. It allows you to create a character and choose a class, with the core gameplay revolving around turn-based combat.

I'm a beginner at coding, so the code is far from perfect — but that was exactly the goal: to practice and improve my understanding of Python basics.

The game is not balanced yet; some items are too weak, others are overpowered, and the same goes for the character abilities. Still, it’s been a fun and valuable learning experience!
